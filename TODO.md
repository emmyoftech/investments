# Phase 5 â€” Frontend Integration & Polish

## Primary objective: Seamless, resilient UX for all flows.

## Tasks

### Replace placeholder data with SWR hooks for /dashboard, /rewards, /transaction, etc. (src/lib/hooks/*)

- [ ] Update transaction/page.tsx to use useDashboard hook for transaction data
- [ ] Update depositHistory/page.tsx to use useDashboard hook
- [ ] Update withdrawalHistory/page.tsx to use a new useWithdrawals hook
- [ ] Create useWithdrawals hook in src/lib/hooks/

- [ ] Implement optimistic updates in investmentPlans/page.tsx for investments
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates in withdrawal/page.tsx for withdrawals

### Accessibility checks and mobile responsive polish
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Add focus indicators
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness on all pages
- [ ] Fix any responsive issues

### End-to-end smoke tests for flows: signup -> deposit -> approval -> invest -> profit -> withdraw
- [ ] Write E2E tests for signup flow
- [ ] Write E2E tests for deposit flow
- [ ] Write E2E tests for approval flow
- [ ] Write E2E tests for investment flow

## Key APIs/Components to Implement/Test

/dashboard, /addFunds, /investmentPlans, /withdrawal, SWR hooks useDashboard, useRewards, AuthContext.tsx.

## Definition of Done

All pages call real APIs and handle states properly.

Full user flows work without manual backend manipulation.

E2E tests pass and UX handles error states cleanly.
